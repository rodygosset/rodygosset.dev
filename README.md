# RODYGOSSET.DEV

This is the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project for my personal portfolio.  
It is [statically generated](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation), and all the data and media I'm using can be found in this repository.

## FEATURES


If you want to learn from how I integrated and implemented this project,  
check out the [How It's Made](https://github.com/rodygosset/rodygosset.dev/blob/main/public/markdown/en/HOWITSMADE.md) page.

The website is available in English and French.

It uses on-scroll animations to give movement to the content.
